Tim Overstreet, founder of streetAV, has been involved in audio and video production for over 20 years. In 2009, Tim started attending a small church in rural Missouri, where he eventually accepted a full time position as the Worship Pastor for the next 7 years. “Our church didn’t have any money, we had to make do with what we had and stretch every dollar,” he recalls. StreetAV was born out of the needs of that church. These same needs are felt by many small to medium sized churches that want excellent audio and visuals to be part of their worship experiences but don't have access to the resources that larger churches might have.

StreetAV isn't just about designing amazing audio and visual rigs, its about connecting the faith community. Tim’s idea is to network with worship pastors across the nation to help churches meet their needs for having high quality audio and visual systems at a fraction of the cost of big sound companies by employing the guys and gals who are already working on the front lines.
