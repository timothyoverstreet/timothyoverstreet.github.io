Tim Overstreet, founder of streetAV, has been involved in audio and video production for over 20 years. In 2009, Tim started attending a small church in rural Missouri, where he eventually accepted a full time position as the Worship Pastor for the next 7 years. “Our church didn’t have any money, we had to make do with what we had and stretch every dollar,” he recalls. StreetAV was born out of the needs of that church. These same needs are felt by many small to medium sized churches that want excellent audio and visuals to be part of their worship experiences but don’t have access to the resources that larger organizations might have.

StreetAV isn't just about designing amazing audio and visual rigs, its about connecting the faith community. Tim’s idea is to network with churches across the nation to meet their needs for having high quality audio and visual systems at a fraction of the cost of big sound companies by employing the guys and gals who are already working on the front lines. 

**What does networking look like?**
Every organization has needs in an area they may not have expertise in. One of your neighboring organizations may have that expertise. By joining the StreetAV network, you'll have access to affordable, hands-on help. Tim remembers being on Staff at Joruney Church and realizing he didn't know it all and needed help. He found that help inside of a community of other pastors who were also trying to make their budgets work.

Some knowledge can be found on a search engine - but what you can't find there is hands-on help and the feeling of community. At Street AV, we want to bridge the denominational divide and help connect people all across the board to the resources they need. Tim and Ashley have a heart for organizations that that are connecting people to the love of Jesus, and would love to team up with you.
